# Roadmap

This is a list of the features and functionality we would like to add in the future.  None of this represents a commitment, it's just a scratchpad for ideas.

Things we think we might get to sooner should be moved higher up in this list.

To work on something,
* [create an issue in GitHub](https://github.com/its-webhosting/umich-oidc-login/issues)
* copy the item from thist list into the issue
* assign the issue to yourself
* move the item to the top of the list in this document and add a link to the issue
* commit the roadmap change to the `main` branch
* remove the item from the roadmap once it is in a production release of the plugin.

## Items

### Multisite support for plugin
* Status: **Pull Request waiting to be merged.**
* Priority: High
* Size: Large
* Reason: Critical need from large University of Michigan units (LSA, Engineering) that heavily use WordPress Multisite.
* Details:
	* Ensure works for both subdomain and subdirectory Multisite installations.
	* WP Native Sessions plugin
		* Does it work as a network-activated plugin?
		* If the UMich OIDC Login plugin is network-activated, warn if the sessions plugin is also not network-activated.
		* Make sure site admins cannot see sessions of users for other site.  Generate a site-specific cookie prefix if needed.
	* Add wp-react-optionskit support for a Multisite network settings page.
	* Figure out how network settings will interact with site settings.
	* Ensure works on: Pantheon, WP Engine, AFS Web Hosting

### Add a "Copy" (to clipboard) button to the `Redirect URI` field
* Priority: Low
* Size: Small
* Reason: Convenience

### Make `Client Secret` field a password field with a "Show" button
* Priority: Low
* Size: Small
* Reason: Security

### Settings page tab for logs
* Priority: Medium
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Allow plugin users to troubleshoot problems without having to ask developers.
* Details:
  * Add a tab to the settings page for logs.
  * Display logs in DataTables table for easy sorting and filtering, opening/closing rows for more/less detail.
  * Denials should include: IP, username, session ID, page, access required, actual access.
  * Button to download logs.
  * Button to clear logs.
  * Allow user to choose log level: logging disabled, denials only, errors, info, debug. (Each log level encompasses all higher levels.)
  * What is the most performant way to store and retrieve logs?  Database?  File?
  * One HTTP request can result in hundreds of log lines at the debugging log level.  What is the best way to handle these?  Write them out one at a time, or all at once at the end of the request?
  * How long should logs be kept?  And/or how many logs should be kept?

### Automated testing
* Priority: High
* Size: Large
* Reason: Plugin is too complex with too many edge cases to test manually; high risk of problems slipping through.
* Details:
  * Add Keycloak server to the Docker Compose setup.
  * Make sure Keycloak can assets a groups claim via OIDC.
  * Modify plugin to fully support Keycloak.
  * Automate the tests currently listed in `docs/testing.md`.
    * End-to-end tests should be the main tests.
    * Unit tests as appropriate.
    * Regression tests as appropriate.
    * Do we want to reuse the one of the two testing frameworks WordPress/Gutenberg uses (below) or make our own technology choices?
      * Gutenberg: https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/explanations/architecture/automated-testing/
      * WordPress: https://github.com/wordpress/wordpress-develop/
  * Create documentation on how a website administrator can set up and use Keycloak with a production website, and link to that from the plugin README.

### Automatically create WordPress accounts for OIDC users who are members of certain groups.
* Priority: High
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Critical need from large University of Michigan units (LSA, Engineering).
* Dependencies: Multisite support (would need significant modification if implemented before Multisite support)
* Details:
  * Needs to be disabled/greyed out if the `Use OIDC for WordPress Users` setting is set to `NO`.
  * The special group `( Logged-in Users )` includes all OIDC users.
  * Allow user to map each WordPress role onto zero or more OIDC groups.  If a group is listed for a role, members of that group will have a WordPress account with that role created for them when they log in via OIDC.  In the example below, members of the groups `unit-website-owners` and `unit-directors` get WordPress administrator accounts created for them automatically when they log in; members of `unit-faculty` get WordPress author accounts, and everyone else in the world gets Subscriber accounts.
    * Administrator: unit-website-owners, unit-directors
    * Editor:
    * Author: unit-faculty
    * Contributor:
    * Subscriber: `( Logged-in Users )`
  * A single group can be used for only one WordPress role.  Adding the same group to multiple roles should be rejected (changes not saved).
  * Auto-created WordPress accounts should be marked with a user term or other indicator that it was auto-created.
  * Provide instructions on how to list auto-created accounts and how to unmark them so they won't be managed by the setting below.
  * Per-role setting for what should happen if a user with an auto-created WordPress account logs in but is not a member of any group for that role.  Options:
    * Leave the user's account associated with the old role.
    * Change the user's role to a specific role (specify)
    * Delete the user's WordPress account.

### Access control for static assets and media files
* Priority: High
* Size: Large
* Reason: Critical need for many websites
* Details:
  * Add access restriction controls (required OIDC groups membership) to Media Library interface.
  * Have a private directory for files that are not managed through the Media Library
    * Allow website administrators to specify different access restrictions for different path prefixes/subdirectories.
      * Example:
        * `/private/` - only members of group A
        * `/private/reports/` - only members of group B
        * `/private/committees/` - only members of groups A or B
  * Protected files need to be opened and streamed to the browser by PHP only after checking access requirements, rather than being served by the web server.
  * Make sure this also fully works for WordPress attachments.
  * Ensure works with WP Engine
  * Ensure works with Pantheon
    * Pantheon does not allow .htaccess files.
    * Files that must not be served can only reside under `wp-content/uploads/private`, see https://pantheon.io/docs/guides/secure-development/private-paths
    * Also see https://pantheon.io/docs/caching-advanced-topics, "Pantheon strips cookies from requests made to public files served from sites/default/files in Drupal and wp-content/uploads in WordPress. This allows the Global CDN to cache the response."
  * Other plugins to refer to for ideas:
    * Good: https://wordpress.org/plugins/private-media/
    * https://wordpress.org/plugins/prevent-file-access/
    * https://buddydev.com/mediapress/settings-options/general-settings/#privacy

### Ensure the plugin works with Solr search
* Priority: Medium
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Solr search is an add-on for Pantheon-hosted websites.
* Details:
  * Test with the Solr plugin Pantheon uses.
  * Test with the top Solr/Lucene plugins in the WordPress plugins directory.
  * Make sure that content on protected posts/pages only shows up in search results if the user searching has permission to view those posts/pages.
  * Make sure content in access-restricting shortcodes only shows up in search results in the user searching has the necessary permissions to view that content.

### Ensure the plugin works with Divi
* Priority: Medium
* Size: Medium
* Reason: many websites use Divi
* Details:
  * Make sure the page/post restriction metabox works.

### Ensure the plugin works with Elementor
* Priority: Medium
* Size: Medium
* Reason: many websites use Elementor
* Details:
  * Make sure the page/post restriction metabox works.

### Hooks to allow customization
* Priority: Low
* Size: Large
* Reason: Allow website administrators to customize the behavior of the plugin; best practice.
* Details:
  * Include filter hooks and action hooks for other plugins/themes to use
	  * for all shortcodes
	  * for each main event or phase (login, log out, create account, link account, ...)
      * for each significant function (determining log-in URL, log-out URL, ...)
  * Document hooks in `docs/hooks.md` and link from the plugin README.

### Publish wp-react-optionskit as its own composer package
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Cleans up the plugin code, allows other plugins to use and contribute to wp-react-optionskit
* Details:
  * Create wp-react-optionskit repo
  * Create wp-react-optionskit documentation
    * Include code for an example plugin
  * Add support for features in wp-optionskit that are missing in wp-react-optionskit:
    * file upload
    * subsections?
  * Create wp-react-optionskit package
  * Switch UMich OIDC Login plugin to use wp-react-optionskit package as a composer dependency

### Sessions tab
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Nice to have
* Details:
  * Add a "Sessions" tab to the settings page allowing admins to see sessions and also log people out.

### Improve `Use OIDC for WP logins` setting UI
* Priority: Low
* Size: Small
* Reason: De-clutter the UI, make it easier to understand
* Details:
  * move the recovery commands to a popup that shows when you click a "Help! I locked myself out" link.
  * move the warnings to a popup that appears when you click "Yes" (or maybe "Save").  Two checkboxes, when both are checked an enable button becomes active that will actually save the change.

### Custom 401 and 403 pages
* Priority: Low
* Size: Small
* Reason: Better user experience
* Details:
  * Setting for URL to send user to (instead of the default plugin error) when a user needs to authenticate.
  * Setting for URL to send user to (instead of the default plugin error) when a user is denied access.

### Restrict access by tag
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Completeness
* Details:
  * For each tag, allow website administrator to specify which groups are allowed to view content with that tag.

### Restrict access by category
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Completeness
* Details:
	* For each category, allow website administrator to specify which groups are allowed to view content in that category.

### Restrict access by URL path
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Completeness
* Details:
  * Allow administrator to specify a list of URL paths
  * For each URL path, restrict access at and below that path to the groups the administrator specifies.
  * More specific (longer) paths take precedence over less specific (shorter) paths; restrictions are not applied hierarchically.

### Guest user support
* Priority: Low
* Size: Large
* Reason: Completeness
* Details:
  * Support U-M Friend accounts as both users and group members.
  * Support U-M Social login accounts as both users and group members.
  * Add new special group, `( Logged-in Guests )`
  * Add new special group, `( Logged-in Non-Guests )`
  * The existing special group `( Logged-in Users )` will encompass both guests and non-guests.

### Add support for refresh tokens
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: React to authorization changes more quickly
* Details:
  * pick up authorization changes within 10 minutes (at U-M), rather than WP session expiration time which could be 1 day.
  * At U-M, IdP config for client needs to be changed to allow refresh_token grant (currently on per-client basis, and not supported via the OIDC provisioning API).
	* See the 8/3/2020 11:09 am TDx comment at https://teamdynamix.umich.edu/TDNext/Apps/31/Tickets/TicketDet.aspx?TicketID=51207

### Support for using Google OIDC as an identity provider
* Priority: Low
* Size: Medium
* Reason: Would be a nice option for non-UM organizations.
* Details:
  * Need to figure out how groups could work.
